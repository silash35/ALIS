[ALIS](https://alis.vercel.app/) (Aggregator of Inclusive Locations for the Deaf) is a network that lists inclusive locations for the deaf. That is, a website where anyone can add places that they know and that have accessibility for the hearing impaired. Get more information by clicking [here](https://alis.vercel.app/sobre).

This repository is where the magic occurs and ALIS is developed. Feel free to help us and contribute to the project, but know that the entire interface of the site is in Portuguese and part of the code as well.

## Getting Started

If you want to run the ALIS development server on your computer, you will need to have Node and PNPM installed. With everything ready, the first step is to rename the ".env.dev" file to ".env".

The second step is to run the following commands:

     pnpm install
     pnpm dev

Finally, go to the indicated URL (Probably [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
